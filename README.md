The Veedu Restaurant landing page is a static, single-page website designed to introduce visitors to the restaurant. Built using HTML and CSS, the page provides a clean and attractive layout featuring essential information about the restaurant. The page includes a header section with the restaurant's name and logo, a hero image or banner showcasing the ambiance, and a brief introductory paragraph describing the restaurant's atmosphere.

The main body of the page includes a section dedicated to highlighting the restaurant's unique selling points, such as its location, special features, and any promotional offers. A contact section is also included, allowing users to find the restaurant's address, phone number, and possibly a form for inquiries or reservations.

While the page focuses on simplicity, it provides users with all the essential details needed to learn about Veedu Restaurant, including visually appealing design elements like images and styled text, making the experience engaging and informative. However, it does not include a menu or responsive features for mobile optimization at the moment.
